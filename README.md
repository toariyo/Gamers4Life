# Gamers4Life
user-interactive gaming website, utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, that allows users to guess several random-generated words based on a category through the “ReverseHangman4Life” game. Within the game, the user is given 6 chances to guess the given word based on the set category of "fruits". However, there are many obscure and rather unknown fruits within this category. As opposed to a regular game of Hangman, within the Reverse Hangman game, the Hangman character starts with all body parts and each incorrect guess causes the Hangman to lose a body part. More games coming soon!!
